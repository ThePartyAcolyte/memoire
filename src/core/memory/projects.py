MEMORY STRUCTURE:
- FRAGMENTS: Store information, insights, notes, and data related to this project
- CONTEXTS: Organize fragments into thematic groups for coherent navigation  
- ANCHORS: Mark important reference points and high-value information

USAGE GUIDELINES:
- Use descriptive categories and tags for fragments
- Organize related information into contexts
- Create anchors for critical insights or frequently referenced information
- Leverage custom fields to capture domain-specific metadata
- Adapt the organization to the nature of your content

This memory system is completely flexible - organize information in whatever way makes most sense for your specific use case."""
